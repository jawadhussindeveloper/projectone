            Licensing and Open-Source Nature
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Open-source (e.g., GPL license), allowing users to modify, distribute, and use the code freely. Developed collaboratively by a global community. <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        Proprietary, closed-source software owned by Microsoft. Users purchase licenses but cannot modify the core system. <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> Proprietary and closed-source, exclusively for Apple hardware. Based on Unix (Darwin kernel is open-source, but the full OS is not). <br>
        <h3 id="keypoints2">
            User Interface (UI) and Customization
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Offers diverse desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE) with high customization. Users can tweak every aspect of the UI.
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        Features a consistent, user-friendly GUI with the Start menu, taskbar, and system tray. Customization is limited compared to Linux.
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        Polished, uniform UI with the Dock and menu bar. Minimal customization to maintain a cohesive Apple ecosystem experience.<br>
        <h3 id="keypoints3">
            Software and Application Support
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Relies on open-source software and package managers (APT, YUM). Limited native commercial software (.g., Adobe Suite), but supports alternatives like LibreOffice. Compatibility layers (Wine) or VMs can run Windows/macos apps.
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        Dominates in software availability, especially for gaming (DirectX) and professional tools (Microsoft Office, Adobe). Uses .exe/.msi installers.
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        Strong in creative software (Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro) and developer tools. Uses .dmg/.pkg installers and the App Store. Fewer games than Windows.
        <br>
        <h3 id="keypoints4">
            Security and Privacy
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Highly secure due to permission models, open-source scrutiny, and minimal malware targeting. SELinux/AppArmor enhance security.
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        Historically vulnerable due to popularity but improved with Defender, Firewall, and regular updates. Telemetry data collection raises privacy concerns.
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        Unix-based security with Gatekeeper, XProtect, and SIP. Privacy-focused but collects some user data for services like Siri.
        <br>
        <h3 id="keypoints5">
            Hardware Compatibility
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Runs on diverse hardware (including older machines), but proprietary drivers (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs) may require manual setup.
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        Broadest hardware support, pre-installed on most PCs. Optimized for peripherals like gaming hardware.
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        Restricted to Apple devices (MacBooks, iMacs). Hackintosh can bypass this but violates terms of service.
        <br>
        <h3 id="keypoints6">
            Cost
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Free to download and use (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora).
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        Paid license (often bundled with PCs). Free upgrades for older versions in some cases.
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        Free with Apple hardware, which is premium-priced.
        <br>
        <h3 id="keypoints7">
            Command Line and Development
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Terminal-centric with powerful tools (Bash, SSH, Git). Preferred by developers and sysadmins.
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        Traditionally GUI-focused but now supports PowerShell and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for cross-platform development.
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        Unix terminal with developer-friendly tools (Homebrew, Xcode). Integrates well with iOS development.
        <br>
        <h3 id="keypoints8">
            File Systems and Permissions
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Ext4/Btrfs with case-sensitive permissions. User/group-based access controls.
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        NTFS (case-insensitive). Permissions managed via ACLs (Access Control Lists).
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        APFS/HFS+ (case-insensitive by default). Inherits Unix permissions with extended attributes.
        <br>
        <h3 id="keypoints9">
            Updates and Stability
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Users control updates; minimal reboots required. Known for server-grade stability.
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        Frequent, sometimes forced updates. Improved stability in recent versions.
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        Regular, non-disruptive updates. Generally stable but less flexible in enterprise environments.
        <br>
        <h3 id="keypoints10">
            Target Audience
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Developers, IT professionals, privacy advocates, and hobbyists.
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        General users, gamers, and businesses relying on Microsoft ecosystems (Office 365, Azure).
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        Creatives, professionals in design/music, and users invested in Appleâ€™s ecosystem (iPhone, iPad).
        <br>
        <h3 id="keypoints11">
            Ecosystem Integration
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Modular, with no default ecosystem but supports cross-platform tools (KDE Connect).
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        Integrates with Xbox, Microsoft 365, and OneDrive.
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        Seamless integration with iOS devices (Handoff, AirDrop, iCloud).
        <br>
        <h3 id="keypoints12">
            Kernel and Architecture
        </h3>
        <b>Linux</b> <br>
        Monolithic kernel with loadable modules.
        <br>
        <b>Windows</b> <br> 
        Hybrid kernel (combines monolithic and microkernel elements).
        <br>
        <b>Mac OS</b> <br> 
        Hybrid XNU kernel (Unix-based).
